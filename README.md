Custom Door Block Template Pack

* This Template Pack includes a custom door block.
* Resource and Behaviour Packs were included in this template.
* Custom block ids: 'block:blue_oak_door'.
* Does not fully achieve the Vanilla Door Blocks Standard (75% Vanilla Block Standard due to the block didn't break when air block is below them, can be placed on another door block, efficient method for sounds, and waterlogged).

<h3>Obtaining the block:</h3>

* /give \<target> block:blue_oak_door
* By crafting recipe, either a wooden door and a blue dye or 6 planks and a blue dye at the middle forming 'H'.

<h3>Gameplay Issues:</h3>

* The item form of the custom door block is quite buggy when placing it. This is a main issue in this Template.
